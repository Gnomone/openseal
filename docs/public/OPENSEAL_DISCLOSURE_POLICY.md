# OpenSeal Disclosure & Boundary Directive

[🇰🇷 한국어 버전 (Korean Version)](./OPENSEAL_DISCLOSURE_POLICY_KR.md)

---

## 0. Purpose

This document clearly defines the **Open (Public)** and **Sealed (Non-Public)** areas of the OpenSeal project to simultaneously achieve:

*   Verifiability
*   Open Source Trust
*   Prevention of Implementation Hijacking
*   Platform Neutrality

---

## 1. Role Definition (Non-Negotiable)

OpenSeal does **NOT**:

*   Execute APIs ❌
*   Orchestrate Requests ❌
*   Make Network Calls ❌
*   Provide Runtime Environment ❌

OpenSeal **ONLY** performs:

> **"A protocol and verifier to prove that an execution result was generated by a pre-fixed code identity."**

---

## 2. Public Scope (Open Source)

The following items are **Fully Open Source** and can be viewed, verified, and forked by anyone.

### 2.1 Conceptual Layer

*   Execution Identity Concept
*   A-Hash → Execution → B-Hash Model
*   Definition of "Result is a State Transition"
*   Threat Model

📌 *Theory is not hidden.*

---

### 2.2 Specification

*   A-Hash Definition
*   B-Hash Definition
*   Verification Input/Output Format
*   Failure Conditions (invalid cases)

```text
Input: (Result, A, B)
Output: VALID | INVALID
```

📌 *Disclosed enough to implement a Verifier.*

---

### 2.3 Verifier

*   `verify()` algorithm
*   Test vectors
*   Reference Implementation (Python / JS etc.)

📌 *Anyone must be able to judge "Is this result valid?".*

---

### 2.4 Security Assumptions

*   What attacks are prevented
*   What attacks are out of scope
*   Why execution is non-reproducible

📌 *Transparency is the premise of trust.*

---

## 3. Sealed Scope (Non-Public)

The following items are **Intentionally Private** by OpenSeal design and are the core protected assets of this project.

---

### 3.1 Execution Capsule Internal Implementation

*   Actual execution order generating A → B
*   Internal state transition methods
*   Intermediate hash / memory / stack processing
*   Hidden states injected during execution

📌 *“Verifiable” ≠ “Reproducible”*

---

### 3.2 Dynamic Function Generation Logic (Dynamic g / b_G)

*   Function structure changing per Random Number R
*   Generation rules for function g
*   Branching, mutation, obfuscation methods

📌 *If this area is exposed, generating forged results becomes possible.*

---

### 3.3 Random Number Distribution & Sync Mechanism

*   Timing of R generation
*   Delivery method
*   Hardware/Environment binding

📌 *This info provides execution synchronization hints to attackers.*

---

### 3.4 Orchestration & Runtime Coupling

*   WASM / Native / Hybrid structure
*   Fetch / I/O coupling method
*   Execution environment hardening

📌 *This is the domain of the execution platform, not OpenSeal.*

---

## 4. Critical Boundary Statement

> **OpenSeal discloses “Verification Rules”.**
> **OpenSeal does NOT disclose “How to Generate Proofs”.**

This boundary is intentional. Implementations violating this are not OpenSeal reference implementations.

---

## 5. Platform Neutrality

OpenSeal is not bound to a specific platform (e.g., HighStation).

However:

*   The **Execution Environment generating proofs** using OpenSeal may be a platform-specific implementation.
*   Such implementations are not included in the OpenSeal open source scope.

📌 *OpenSeal is the Standard, Platform is a Choice.*

---

## 6. License & Contribution Guidelines

*   OpenSeal Spec / Verifier are provided under Open Source License.
*   PRs requesting execution generation logic may be rejected.
*   Forks violating this directive cannot claim "OpenSeal Compatibility".

---

## 7. Final Declaration

> OpenSeal aims for
> **"Execution Proof that everyone can verify, but no one can fabricate."**

This open/closed boundary is a **Design Philosophy**, not a technical limitation.
