# 🧶 OpenSeal: Design Rationale & Disclosure Policy

This document defines the high-level design philosophy, threat model, and strategic disclosure policy for OpenSeal v2.0.

---

## 1. Design Rationale

OpenSeal is built on the principle that **"Execution is Proof."** In the era of AI agents and automated infrastructure, verifying API response integrity without relying on a centralized authority is the critical link for establishing total trust.

### Why OpenSeal?
- **Universal Integrity**: Unlike TEEs that require specialized hardware or ZK proofs with high computational overhead, OpenSeal provides a **Practical Integrity Layer** that works across any language and OS.
- **Protocol Over Infrastructure**: OpenSeal is not just a runtime; it is a **Standard Protocol** that binds a result to a specific, immutable code identity.
- **Strategic Moat**: By focusing on the logic-to-result binding, OpenSeal creates a standard that is easy to adopt but difficult to replicate in its operational security and ecosystem integration.

## 2. Threat Model & Guarantees

We define the boundaries of what OpenSeal explicitly protects to ensure an "Honest Execution" model.

### ✅ What We Guarantee
- **Logic Integrity**: Verifiers can be 100% certain that the result was generated by the *exact* same source code (A-hash) publicly audited or registered.
- **Freshness (Anti-Replay)**: Every response is bound to a specific, one-time challenge (Wax), preventing attackers from reusing old, valid responses.
- **Sandbox Isolation**: The application runs in a sanitized environment where the parent process (OpenSeal) intercepts all I/O to prevent silent manipulation.

### ❌ What is Out of Scope
- **Host Memory Security**: We do not claim to prevent a super-user with physical access from hooking memory *during* execution. This is the domain of TEEs.
- **External Data Truth**: OpenSeal proves the **Logic was honest**, not that the external data fetched by that logic (e.g., an external exchange rate) is objectively true.

## 3. Layered Disclosure Model (A-E Layers)

OpenSeal distributes code and binaries across five distinct layers to balance transparency with operational security.

| Layer | Component | Disclosure | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layer A** | UX / CLI | ✅ **Open Source** | Accelerate adoption and trust. |
| **Layer B** | Identity Logic | ✅ **Open Source** | Transparency in how code is hashed. |
| **Layer C** | Runtime Mediation | ❌ **Private / Interface** | Prevent runtime bypass attacks. |
| **Layer D** | Seal Generation | ❌ **Strictly Private** | Protect the core "Economic Moat". |
| **Layer E** | Verifier | ✅ **Open Source** | The "Trust Anchor" for everyone. |

## 4. Trust Model

### Platform for Discovery, Cryptography for Trust

OpenSeal's trust comes from **mathematical verification**, not from a central platform.

| Role | Platform (HighStation) | OpenSeal Cryptography |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Provider Discovery** | ✅ Platform provides | - |
| **Reputation Management** | ✅ Platform provides | - |
| **Payment Facilitation** | ✅ Platform provides | - |
| **Result Verification** | ❌ Platform not needed | ✅ Anyone verifies independently |

### Anyone, Anywhere, Anytime

- **Providers**: Self-test before deployment
- **Consumers**: Verify API response integrity
- **Auditors**: Independent third-party validation
- **Platforms**: Verification for reputation scoring

All use the same open-source verifier and operate without central authority.

---

## 5. Privacy & Integrity Commitment

The OpenSeal Protected Runtime is built on a **Zero-Backend Policy**:
- **Zero Data Collection**: No user data, execution results, or metadata are collected or stored.
- **Zero Outbound Communication**: The core generation engine operates in complete isolation, performing no unauthorized network calls.
- **Auditable Boundary**: The interface boundary (ABI/IPC) between the open CLI and protected runtime is clearly defined and auditable.

---

## 5. Final Declaration
> **"Anyone can verify the proof, but the security of the generation core is guaranteed by a protected boundary."**

OpenSeal prioritizes the **Integrity of the Ecosystem** over total academic transparency. We provide trust through mathematics and operational consistency.
